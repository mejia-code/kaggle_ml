### TRANSPORTATION LIFESTYLE

1. Please describe how you are prioritizing a lifestyle leveraging public
   transportation, micro-mobility, and other alternatives to private cars.

a. Our family uses one EV car for our extended range trips, significantly reducing our driving. Instead, we now grow food, make food at home, and enjoy the local parks and markets. Walking is a large part of our exercise and time
together. We are looking for a greenhouse to partner with on food projects. To sum up, we strongly desire to avoid cars and solve systemic challenges to improve everyone's quality of life.

2. What micromobility have you tried/have experience with? Is there something
   new in this space that you're particularly excited about trying?

a. Walking every day is most important in addition to using a longboard every day to get around. Excited about bikes to carry food and household items. The Maker Space is another critical element to help guarantee a micro-mobility culture. For instance, we talked to the owner of a maker space in San Diego during our trips as we were looking for
investors.
Also, most excited to meet the people and build a community together.

### WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOODS

3. Why do you think there aren't enough walkable neighborhoods in the US?

Systemic replacement of community functions divided by category:

#### State:

a. City planners are taught and trained by a system that prioritizes cars, parking, and shopping. As a result, they view greenspace as expensive and asphalt as cheap.

#### Corporate:

b. Our social technology has forgotten that time spent in the community has
multiplicative effects. Serendipitous education with close neighbors on personal projects, for example.

#### Agriculture:

c. Growing food together was replaced with the convenience of frozen food at the grocery stores. Restaurants and asphalt replaced gardens.

#### Transportation:

c. Auto groups have extensive political power and State backing as strategic manufacturers.

#### Medical:

c. It was common to have a local physician that could walk to a patient's home. Now we
drive to hospitals often for sickness caused by sedentary lifestyles.

#### Consumption:

c. Strong marketing and movies programming people to abuse the use of transportation.
